WATER DATA PIPELINE AUTOMATION
Large-scale project working from the pre-data collection, to data collection and display, processing and uploading, and analysis report generation, all automated to the fullest extent possible.  This document will outline the work conducted for this project, and capture pieces of the process so that none of the effort is lost.  This is intended to be a capstone Geospatial Data Science project, save considerable time doing real NHBP work, and could even be packaged as an entire water quality data system.
